# ErasmusPartyAppWeb

This project was just an addition for my android app. The project is not really functional anymore but still available on https://erasmuspartyapp.firebaseapp.com/.
For more details about the project go to my ErasmusPartyApp repository.

This Project was my first Angular project, done while being on Erasmus in Lithuania ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹. 
I am sure it is full of mistakes since I had no idea about code structure and a lot of other important things at that time. 
But everybody starts small I guess ;-). Feel free to check it out.



## Development server
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
